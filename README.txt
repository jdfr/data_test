This project contains some STL binary files that are used as test input data. In principle, very similar files can be generated from very little binary data (1-5kb), but that generation code is not implemented yet. To avoid polluting the other repository with large binary commits that will go away at some point, we store them in another, (hopefully) temporary repository.
