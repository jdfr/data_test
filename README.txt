This project contains some STL binary files that are used as test input data for other projects. In principle, very similar files can be generated from very little binary data (1-5kb), but that generation code is not implemented yet (hopefully, I'll get to it someday...). To avoid polluting the other repository with large binary commits that might go away at some point, we store them in another repository.

This project is released with the AGPLv3 license.
